## INCLUDE BOOTSTRAP VIA CDN

We will use a CDN [(Content delivery network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) to enable Bootstrap on our page.

Using Bootstrap CDN means that we will not download and store the bootstrap files in our server or local machine. We will just include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript links on our web page.
